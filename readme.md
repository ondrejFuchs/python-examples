# Code test
Therefore, it is a requirement to write all the answers in python3.8 unless something else is specified.

It is not only about how much of the code test you complete but also the quality of your code (think of PEP20)

## Installation
1. Create a virtualenv with python 3.8 `virtualenv -p python3.8 python_code_test` 
2. Activate the virtualenv `source python_code_test/bin/activate`
3. Install the requirements `pip install -r ./requirements.txt`

## Exercises
PS: You are free to follow the exercises in any order you want.

PS2: There might be some bugs in code/tests, you get bonus points for detecting and fixing such bugs ;)

PS3: You are free to add any 3rd party dependency you want (but please update requirements.txt)

PS4: There is a lot to do and you are not expected to complete everything :)

1. [test_ex1.py](tests/test_ex1.py) -> make the tests pass
2. [decorators.py](src/ex1/decorators.py) -> implement the description
3. [test_ex2.py](tests/test_ex2.py) -> make the tests pass
4. [dataclasses.py](src/ex3/dataclasses_exercises.py) -> make the doctests pass
5. [test_ex4.py](tests/test_ex4.py) -> implement the fixture and tests and implement the code in [wheelme_lines.py](src/ex4/wheelme_lines.py)
6. [test_ex5.py](tests/test_ex5.py) -> make the test pass and doctests in [immutable_class.py](src/ex5/immutable_class.py)
7. [test_ex6.py](tests/test_ex6.py) -> make the tests pass
